Schema Registry Mock
====================

Mock your Schema Registry in Kafka Streams Tests.

You can find a [blog post on medium](https://medium.com/bakdata/transparent-schema-registry-for-kafka-streams-6b43a3e7a15c) with some examples and detailed explanations of how the Schema Registry Mock works with the Fluent Kafka Streams Tests framework.

## Getting Started
You can find the Schema Registry Mock via Maven Central. 

#### Gradle
```gradle
compile group: 'com.bakdata', name: 'schema-registry-mock', version: '1.0.0'
```

#### Maven
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.bakdata</groupId>
    <artifactId>schema-registry-mock</artifactId>
    <version>1.0.0</version>
</dependency>
```

For other build tools or versions, refer to the [latest version in MvnRepository](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.bakdata.fluent-kafka-streams-tests/schema-registry-mock/latest).

## Using it in Tests

There are two ways to use the Mock Schema Registry, 
together with the Fluent Kafka Streams Tests 
or as a standalone module in your existing test framework.

### With Fluent Kafka Streams Tests

Using the Mock Schema Registry with the Fluent Kafka Streams Tests is very straightforward.
All you need to do, is set your (default) serde to `GenericAvroSerde` or `SpecificAvroSerde`, so that your topology actually needs to use the Schema Registry.
The `TestTopology` takes care of updating the Kafka config with the url of the Mock Schema Registry for you.

You can then write a simple test that uses Avro, without having to deal with the Schema Registry.

```java
@Test
void shouldAggregateInhabitants() {
  this.testTopology.input()
    .add(new Person("Huey", "City1"))
    .add(new Person("Dewey", "City2"))
    .add(new Person("Louie", "City1"));

  this.testTopology.tableOutput().withValueType(City.class)
    .expectNextRecord().hasKey("City1").hasValue(new City("City1", 2))
    .expectNextRecord().hasKey("City2").hasValue(new City("City2", 1))
    .expectNoMoreRecord();
}
```

 
### As a Standalone Module 
To use this in your tests, you need to do three things: 

- Setup the `SchemaRegistryMock` as an extension of your test.
```java
class SchemaRegistryMockTest {
    @RegisterExtension
    final SchemaRegistryMock schemaRegistry = new SchemaRegistryMock();
    ...
}
```
 - Set the serde of your key and/or value to `GenericAvroSerde` or `SpecificAvroSerde`, so that your topology actually needs to use the Schema Registry.
 - Set the `AbstractKafkaAvroSerDeConfig.SCHEMA_REGISTRY_URL_CONFIG` to `schemaRegistry.getSchemaRegistryUrl()`, so that your test knows where to find the Schema Registry.
```java
@Test
void customTest() {
  Properties properties = new Properties();
  properties.setProperty(AbstractKafkaAvroSerDeConfig.SCHEMA_REGISTRY_URL_CONFIG, this.getSchemaRegistryUrl());
  ...
  testDriver = new TopologyTestDriver(topology, properties);
}
```

After that, you can write a test that uses the Schema Registry in your testing framework. 


## Development
